Problem Introduction:

The insurance approval process, i.e., underwriting is one of the important and time-consuming tasks in an insurance application processing. When you submit your insurance application, the underwriter of the company evaluates it based on the details that you provide using a rule-based or an ML model and decides whether or not to approve your application.

An insurance company InsurePlus wants you to help them with finding the optimal number of staff that they need for their insurance application approval process for the calendar year 2021.  In the industry, the number of staffs is considered as a continuous variable. This is also called a Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) of the staff. For example, if a full-time employee (FTE =1) works for 50 hours a week, 10 hours corresponds to 0.2 FTEs. If the pay for 50 hours a week is $5000, then 0.2 FTE who may be a part-time employee will be paid $1000 (5000*0.2).

The company wants to know the optimised staffing recommendations for the business case described.  Write the mathematical model for the deterministic optimisation problem. Define and explain your decision variables, objective function and the constraint

The company also wants to know the staffing recommendations for the worst-case and best-case scenarios. As mentioned earlier, there are days that an employee will be unavailable to process applications due to training, off days, etc. This will affect employee availability.
